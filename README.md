# Credit-Card-Customers

*Project Overview*
This project focuses on the segmentation of credit card customers using the K-means clustering algorithm. 
The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their credit card usage and other related attributes. 
This segmentation can be instrumental for banks and financial institutions to tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer service.

The input data is resulting from the Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata/data) by Arjun Bhasin.

*Features*
Data Preprocessing: Techniques to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights from the data through various statistical and visualization techniques.
K-means Clustering: Implementation of K-means to segment customers.
Cluster Analysis: Detailed analysis of each customer segment.
Business Insights: Translation of technical findings into actionable business strategies.
Dataset
